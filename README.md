This repository captures the MADICES Week conception for a minimal, interoperable PCL-to-PCL exchange pattern.  
It benefited from conversations with Peter Kraus (TU Berlin), Matthew Evans (Cambridge), and Simon Stier (Fraunhofer).

It uses:

- RO-Crate as the packaging and JSON-LD context carrier  
- JSON Schema for validating the *envelope* and *error contract*  
- SHACL shapes for validating *content nodes* such as measurement requests and workflow launches

## Overview

The goal of this work is to define a **minimum viable contract** for structured, machine-actionable exchange between programmable cloud laboratories (PCLs).  
It aims to balance minimalism with interoperability, enabling autonomous or semi-autonomous lab-to-lab operations using well-established web standards and persistent identifiers (PIDs).

## What is the Minimum Viable Contract for a Receiving PCL?

*(Reflective question: Can the following list be minimized?)*

### 1. Who and Where
- Identifiers for sending PCL (**ROR**), person (**ORCID**), and public key reference (**DID**)
- Intended receiver identifier (**ROR**) *(maybe? not sure really)*  
- Stable message ID, creation time, and protocol/profile version

### 2. Payload Understandability
- Canonical schema identifier and version for the payload body
- Encoding and optional compression or encryption info *(?)*
- Content checksum for verification check

### 3. Intent (What to Do with the Content)
- Action verb from a **closed vocabulary**, e.g.  
  `register_data`, `request_measurement`, `launch_workflow`, `update_metadata`, `cancel_job`  
  *(Reflective: can we agree a simple schema or can this be done by context interpretation?)*
- Minimal capability requirement expressed as a **feature tag**, e.g.  
  `capability: xrd/powder/θ–2θ`, `workflow: cwl@v1.2`

### 4. About Which Research Object
- Project PID (**DataCite DOI** or **RAiD**)
- Sample PID (**IGSN**)
- Optional: workflow, instrument, and facility identifiers

### 5. Authorization
- Token or other credential with defined scope
- Data use constraints *(there will be users who want their data to be private; may need an ontology for the options so a receiver can decide if they can honor the constraints)*

### 6. Routing and Responses
- Acknowledge receipt with a callback channel
- Schedule constraints such as deadline and priority

### 7. Provenance Crumbs
- Who constructed the payload
- When
- From which upstream artifacts

--

## Optional Additions for Version 2

*(Reflective: Not necessary but useful?)*

- Version negotiation workflows  
- Replay protection for action requests  
- Validation hooks (JSON Schema or SHACL shape URI)  
- Explicit time zone and units  
- Error contract  
- Data sensitivity tagging

## Ontology Stack

**Do not** invent a new ontology.  
Compose a small, interoperable stack and use an **RO-Crate Profile** to bundle it.

- **RO-Crate** as the container and JSON-LD context carrier, with a profile URI that says “this is a PCL-to-PCL action crate.”
- **W3C PROV-O** for provenance of the message and any included data or workflow
- **schema.org** types for high-level objects (`Dataset`, `SoftwareSourceCode`, `CreativeWork`)
- **CWL**, **CWLProv**, or **WfProv/WfDesc** for workflows and runs when the intent is to execute
- **Persistent Identifiers (PIDs):**
  - Project: DOI or RAiD
  - Sample: IGSN
  - People: ORCID
  - Organizations: ROR
  - Instruments or facilities: PIDInst (DataCite) and RRID
  - Units: QUDT or OM for quantities and units
  - Verifiable credentials: W3C Verifiable Credentials / Presentations
  - Data use policy: ODRL (Open Digital Rights Language)
- **Events:** map the envelope to **CloudEvents** fields so you can move it over Kafka, NATS, or HTTP consistently.

## Two Layers Inside the RO-Crate

The RO-Crate structure for PCL exchange consists of **two distinct layers**:

### 1. Envelope Entity (Machine Routing and Validation)
Defines the outer envelope that carries metadata required for validation and routing.

| Field | Description |
|-----|----------|
| `type` | `PCLActionEnvelope` (a profile class) |
| `profile` | URI of the RO-Crate profile |
| `id`, `time`, `sender`, `receiver` | Identification and timing info |
| `schema` | URI for the body schema and version |
| `hash`, `size`, `encoding`, `encryption` | Verification and transfer info |
| `action` | Controlled vocabulary term |
| `capabilities` | List of required features |
| `authz` | JWT in detached JWS form, or a Verifiable Presentation reference |

### 2. Content Entity (Domain Payload)
The payload itself, one of the five closed-vocabulary action verbs:

| Action | Entity Type | Minimal Required Fields |
|--------|----------|--------|
| `register_data` | `Dataset` | `name`, `identifier`, one `distribution` (`DataDownload` with `contentUrl`, `encodingFormat`, `sha256`) |
| `request_measurement` | `Action` | `instrument`, `object` (sample), `prov:used` (method), `parameter` |
| `launch_workflow` | `SoftwareSourceCode` | `name`, `programmingLanguage`, embedded descriptor or `codeRepository`, `parameter` |
| `update_metadata` | `UpdateAction` | `object` (target IRI), one or more `parameter` replacements (name restricted to `name`, `description`, `license`, `keywords`) |
| `cancel_job` | `Action` | `object` as a `PropertyValue` with `name: correlationId` referencing the original request's `correlationId` |

`update_metadata` is replace-only in v1: each `parameter` overwrites the named field on the referenced resource. It does not support merge, delete, or arbitrary-field patching. `cancel_job` targets the originating request's `correlationId`, not a receiver-local job identifier, since only the sender-issued value is guaranteed to be known to both parties. `ack` and `nack` are protocol-level response statuses, not domain action verbs, and have no content shape of their own.
